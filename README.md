## Project Setup

To run this project, you need to set up a Supabase project and configure your environment variables. The following SQL script is idempotent, meaning you can run it multiple times without causing errors.

### 1. Supabase Project Setup

1.  **Create a Project**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a new project.
2.  **Get API Keys**: In your project dashboard, navigate to **Project Settings** > **API**. You will find your **Project URL** and `anon` **public** key.
3.  **Create Database Table & Policies**: Go to the **SQL Editor** in your dashboard and run the entire query block below. This will create the `appointments` table and set the required access policies.

    ```sql
    -- Create the table for appointments
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.appointments (
      id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
      customer_name text NOT NULL,
      customer_phone text NOT NULL,
      image_urls jsonb NOT NULL,
      status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending'::text,
      admin_notes text NULL,
      CONSTRAINT appointments_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

    -- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for the table if not already enabled
    ALTER TABLE public.appointments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Drop the policy if it exists, to make the script re-runnable
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all access for anon users" ON public.appointments;

    -- Create a policy to allow public access for the appointments table
    CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for anon users"
    ON public.appointments
    FOR ALL
    TO anon
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);
    ```

4.  **Create Storage Bucket & Policies**:
    -   Navigate to the **Storage** section.
    -   Click **New bucket**.
    -   Enter `wheel-images` as the bucket name.
    -   Toggle **Public bucket** to ON.
    -   Click **Create bucket**.
    -   After creating the bucket, go back to the **SQL Editor** and run the following script to set the required policies for image uploads.

    ```sql
    -- Drop policies if they exist, to make the script re-runnable
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon read access" ON storage.objects;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon upload access" ON storage.objects;

    -- Create a policy to allow anonymous users to view images.
    CREATE POLICY "Allow anon read access"
    ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
    TO anon
    USING ( bucket_id = 'wheel-images' );

    -- Create a policy to allow anonymous users to upload images.
    CREATE POLICY "Allow anon upload access"
    ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
    TO anon
    WITH CHECK ( bucket_id = 'wheel-images' );
    ```

### 2. Environment Variables

This project requires three environment variables to connect to the necessary services. You will need to set these in your development environment (e.g., in a `.env` file if you were running this locally with a build tool, or directly in your deployment service).

-   `API_KEY`: Your API key for the Gemini API.
-   `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
-   `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase `anon` public key.
-   `SHEET_BEST_URL` (Optional): The connection URL for Google Sheets sync. See instructions below.

The application code (`index.tsx`) reads these variables using `process.env`.


---
### Optional: Real-time Google Sheets Sync

You can configure the application to automatically send all new and updated appointment data to a Google Sheet in real-time.

1.  **Create a Google Sheet**:
    -   Create a new sheet in your Google account.
    -   In the first row, create the following headers exactly: `id`, `created_at`, `customer_name`, `customer_phone`, `image_urls`, `status`, `admin_notes`.

2.  **Use a Webhook Service (Sheet.best)**:
    -   Go to [sheet.best](https://sheet.best) and sign up for a free account.
    -   Click **+ New Connection**.
    -   Paste the URL of your Google Sheet into the **Connection URL** field and give it a name.
    -   Sheet.best will generate a new **Connection URL** for you. This is your webhook URL.
    -   Click on your new connection to go to its **Details** page.
    -   Under **Available methods for `id` column**, enable **PATCH**. This is required for updating the status of existing appointments.

3.  **Set Environment Variable**:
    -   Copy the **Connection URL** from Sheet.best.
    -   Set it as the `SHEET_BEST_URL` environment variable in your project.

> **Security Warning**: Your Sheet.best connection URL is a secret. Anyone with this URL can write data to your Google Sheet. Do not expose it publicly.

Once Supabase and your environment variables are configured, the application will be fully functional.
